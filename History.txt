=== 1.3.6-rc2/21.12.2016
* TODO: Fix 8 failing unit tests
* Made SBSM multithreading optional. Defaults to off
* Answer with doc_root + '/index.html' if request-path is '/'
* Introduce RackInterface to separate concerns between SBSM::App which is member variable of the SBSM::Session
* An the RackInterface which is served as a Rack App object

=== 1.3.5 /14.12.2016
* Refactored sbsm to work without DRb
* Added test/config.ru to be able to run tests via wrk
* The interface to Session.new changed and must be adapted by client where the SBSM::Session class is overridden.

=== 1.3.4 /12.12.2016
* As we quite often got errors about recycled objects, I added a GC.start in the call method of sbsm/app
  It introduces a delay of 12 to 30 ms. Therefore we should look for a better solution later

=== 1.3.3 / 7.12.2016
* Hashes are handled differently in mod_ruby and rack add a test for it, but I am unsure
  whether I handle everything is okay, as I had to add article to the STRINGS in davaz.compatible
  to make the app work again
** mod_ruby workedwith @request.params["hash[3]"] = "6"
** rack works like @request.params['real_hash'] = {'1' => 'a', '2' => 'b'}

* Moved from mod_ruby to using webrick/rack interface

* changed now in the params field (to be compatible with Rack::Request). The SBSM::Request field notes has gone!
* See changes in steinwies.ch which were minimal
** Removed an unused require 'sbsm/request' in src/view/navbar.rb
** added a config.ru
** Changed Steinwies::App to derive from SBSM::App instead of SBSM::DRbServer and its initialize method
** The Session.initialize method had to pass a validator when calling super

* Open problems
** Handling redirects is not tested (and probably will not work)
** Handling passthru is not tested (and probably will not work)
